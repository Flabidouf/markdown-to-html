### A funny story
Once, in my last year of secondary school, I had to play piano for my school's Christmas mass. I organized a prank where I would play "Still Dre" by Dr Dre at the end of my performance. I did it and it was quite funny to hear this tune in a church.

#### TL;DR : I played Still Dre by Dr Dre in a church as a Christmas mass song.
